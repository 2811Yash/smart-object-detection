**Image Segmentation and Object Description with Streamlit**

This project provides a user-friendly Streamlit application that analyzes images and generates descriptions and summaries for the objects it detects.

# Features:

# Object Detection:
Automatically identifies and highlights objects in uploaded images using a pre-trained DETR model.
Generative Descriptions & Summaries: Uses a Google Generative AI model to create short descriptions and summaries for each detected object, enhancing image understanding.
# Summary Table: 
Presents the identified objects along with their descriptions and summaries in a clear and organized table.
Text Recognition (Optional): If the uploaded image primarily contains text, the app employs an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model to extract and display the text content.

# Requirements:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
Pillow (PIL Fork)
OpenCV-Python
requests
dotenv
google-generativeai
langchain
pandas
Installation:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this project's files.
3. Run the following command to install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Running the App:

Obtain a valid Google API key for the generative AI model. Refer to the google-generativeai documentation for instructions.
Save the provided code as a Python script (e.g., app.py).

# Run the application using the following command:

streamlit run app.py


# How it Works:

- Image Upload: The application provides a file uploader where you can select and upload an image.
- Object Detection: The uploaded image is processed by the DETR model to detect objects within the image.
- Bounding Boxes: Detected objects are visually highlighted on the image using bounding boxes.
- Object Descriptions and Summaries: The generative AI model analyzes each detected object and generates concise descriptions and summaries, providing additional context.
- Summary Table: A pandas DataFrame is created to display the detected objects alongside their corresponding descriptions and  summaries, offering a structured representation of the image content.
- Text Recognition (if applicable): If the image primarily contains text with minimal objects, the OCR model extracts the text content for display.

# Disclaimer:

A valid Google API key is necessary for the generative AI model functionality.

# Further Development:

This project has potential for enhancements, including:

- Implementing error handling for various image formats or processing failures.
- Allowing users to adjust parameters for the object detection or generative AI models.
- Integrating a model selection interface for different detection or generation tasks.
